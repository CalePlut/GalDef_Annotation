    <h2>Valence</h2>
    <p>Valence is sometimes called "pleasantness", and is associated with pleasure or attractiveness<br>
        Events that are desirable, or that we want, are positively valenced, and events that are undesirable, that we don't want, are negatively valenced</p>
    <p>Valence is independent of the activity level<br>
        Excitement is an active positively valenced emotion, while satisfaction is an inactive positively valenced emotion<br>
        Nervousness is an active negatively valenced emotion, while boredom is an inactive negatively valenced emotion</p>
    <p>Examples of high-valence emotions include joy, excitement, satisfaction, or triumph<br>Examples of low-valence emotions include sadness, fear, anger, or disgust</p>
    <p>Examples of high-valence activities in games may be passing an opponent in a driving game, finishing a quest in an RPG, and landing a combo in a fighting game<br>
        Examples of low-valence activities in games may be being passed in a driving game, losing a unit in a tactics game, and winning an objective in a MOBA </p>

<template id="arousal_instructions">
    <h2>Arousal</h2>
    <p>Arousal is an emotional dimension associated with energy or activity</p>
    <p>Arousal is a state of heightened activity, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. The level of arousal describes the activity or energy of an emotion</p>
    <p>Exhuberation/Joy is a pleasant high-arousal emotion, while hate is an unpleasant high-arousal emotion - both are highly energetic</p>
    <p>Contentment is a pleasant low-arousal emotion, while guilt is an unpleasant low-arousal emotion - both are low-energy</p>
    <p>Examples of high-arousal emotions include excitement, anger, or triumph<br>
        Examples of low-arousal emotions include satisfaction, depression, exhaustion, or relaxation</p>

<template id="tension_instructions">
    <h2>Tension</h2>
    <p>Tension is an emotional dimension associated with events in the future. Tension may be pleasant or unpleasant</p> 
    <p>Excitement is a pleasant, high-tension emotion - something that we want might be coming<br>
    Satisfaction is a pleasant, low-tension emotion - something we wanted has happened<br>
    Fear is an example of an unpleasant, high-tension emotion - something that we don't want might be coming<br>
    Sadness is an example of low negative tension - something we didn't want has happened</p>
    <p>Examples of high-tension emotions include fear, excitement, or unease<br>
        Examples of low-tension emotions include satisfaction, sadness, and joy</p>
    <p>
        Examples of high-tension situations in games may be playing X-Com, when a shell is coming in Mario Kart, or when you thing your opponent is about to use their full meter in a fighting game<br>
