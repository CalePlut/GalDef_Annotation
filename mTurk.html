<template id="valence_instructions">
    <h2>Valence</h2>
    <p>Valence is sometimes called "pleasantness", and is associated with pleasure or attractiveness<br>
        Events that are desirable, or that we want, are positively valenced, and events that are undesirable, that we don't want, are negatively valenced</p>
    <p>Valence is independent of the activity level<br>
        Excitement is an active positively valenced emotion, while satisfaction is an inactive positively valenced emotion<br>
        Nervousness is an active negatively valenced emotion, while boredom is an inactive negatively valenced emotion</p>
    <p>Examples of high-valence emotions include joy, excitement, satisfaction, or triumph<br>
        Examples of low-valence emotions include sadness, fear, anger, or disgust</p>
    <p>Examples of high-valence activities in games may be passing an opponent in a driving game, finishing a quest in a role-playing game (RPG), and landing a combo in a fighting game<br>
        Examples of low-valence activities in games may be being passed in a driving game, losing a unit in a tactics game, and losing an objective in a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA)</p>
        <p>In Galactic Defense, high-valence activities include, but are not limited to, defeating an opponent, dealing a large amount of damage, or absorbing a heavy laser<br>
            Low-valence activities in Galactic Defense include being defeated, receiving a heavy laser attack, or receiving large amounts of damage</p>

<template id="arousal_instructions">
    <h2>Arousal</h2>
    <p>Arousal is an emotional dimension associated with energy or activity</p>
    <p>Arousal is a state of heightened activity, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. The level of arousal describes the activity or energy of an emotion</p>
    <p>Exhuberation/Joy is a pleasant high-arousal emotion, while hate is an unpleasant high-arousal emotion - both are highly energetic</p>
    <p>Contentment is a pleasant low-arousal emotion, while guilt is an unpleasant low-arousal emotion - both are low-energy</p>
    <p>Examples of high-arousal emotions include excitement, anger, or triumph<br>
        Examples of low-arousal emotions include satisfaction, depression, exhaustion, or relaxation</p>
    <p>In games, arousal is linked to the activity level of the game, or the amount of things going on</p>    
    <p>Examples of high-arousal activities in games may include executing a combo in a fighting game, or completing a series of jumps in a platforming game  <br>
    Examples of low-arousal activities in games may include waiting for a cooldown to finish, blocking a series of attacks, or watching for opponent actions</p>
    <p>In Galactic Defense, some high-arousal activities include firing a combo or laser, firing to interrupt an opponent's heal, or absorbing a heavy laser and returning fire</p>
    <p>Examples of low-arousal activities in Galactic Defense include watching the opponent to parry a heavy laser or stopping fire to raise shields</p>
</template>

<template id="tension_instructions">
    <h2>Tension</h2>
    <p>Tension is an emotional dimension associated with events in the future. Tension may be pleasant or unpleasant</p> 
    <p>Excitement is a pleasant, high-tension emotion - something that we want might be coming<br>
    Satisfaction is a pleasant, low-tension emotion - something we wanted has happened<br>
    Fear is an example of an unpleasant, high-tension emotion - something that we don't want might be coming<br>
    Sadness is an example of low negative tension - something we didn't want has happened</p>
    <p>Examples of high-tension emotions include fear, excitement, or unease<br>
        Examples of low-tension emotions include satisfaction, sadness, and joy</p>
    <p>
        Examples of high-tension situations in games may be playing X-Com, when a shell is coming in Mario Kart, or when you think your opponent is about to use their full meter in a fighting game<br>
        Examples of low-tension situations in games may be being comfortably in the lead in a driving game, resting at a bonfire in Dark Souls, or predicting an inescapable checkmate in chess
    </p>
    <p>Examples of high-tension situations in Galactic Defense include, but are not limited to, attempting to parry an incoming heavy laser, or having low shields when an attack is expected</p>
    <p>Examples of low-tension situations in Galactic Defense include having successfully parried a heavy laser, having recently defeated an opponent, or having recently fired a full combo</p>

   <h2>Annotation instructions</h2>
   <p id="annot_instr">You will be presented 4 videos of recorded gameplay from Galactic Defense<br>

        <h2>What is the purpose of this study?</h2>
        <p>We are collecting data on the effects of music on emotional perception of a video game while watching a video of gameplay. In other words, we are collecting data on how music may affect the emotions that an audience perceives
            <br> This data will be used to evaluate a psychological emotion model, and various applications of music in video games</p>
        <h2>Your participation is voluntary</h2>

          <br>  For the second phase, you will be shown 4 videos of recorded gameplay of the video game. You will be asked to provide real-time annotation about the emotion that you perceive while watching the videos, rooting for the player<br>
           Each video will have a different musical score, and you may find that these different musical scores express different emotional curves
